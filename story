<pre>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, J.K. Rowling
J.K. Rowling is a master plotter. In her Harry Potter series, we meet Harry and, soon thereafter, two characters who go on to become his closest friends. Once the introduction is established, we learn of Harry's quest to secure the Sorcerer's Stone.
As for the conflict, Professor Snape is also after the Stone. In a climactic moment, Harry and his friends defeat an evil troll released by Professor Snape. Although resolution is achieved when Harry secures the Stone, the series is able to continue on with six more books.</pre>
